                            <h2>Hair On Leather</h2>
                            <p> Hair on leather is exactly what it sounds like. It is leather that has hair on it. 
                                Specifically it is leather that still has the original hair on it, making it look like it came straight off the cow!
                                Basically if the animal has skin that is covered with a coat of hair, you can make hair on leather out of it. 
                                And I have yet to find a time when it doesn’t look awesome.</p>

                            <p> Harness Oil Pull-up leather is a nubuck with a grease or wax finish. Through use (kinking, stretching, abrasion, etc.), visible traces of wear are quickly formed, as with all waxy leathers. Beneath the wax finish
                                is a sanded surface, so that the patina-development on pull-up leather is fast and strong.There are also leathers, where the surface is not sanded before greasing or waxing. They are aniline leathers. 
                                With these leathers, the patina development is not as fast and strong as with the nubuck (sanded) pull-up leathers. Also, this version is often referred to as pull-up.</p>

                            <h2>Patent Finish leather</h2>
                            <p>Patent Finish leather is leather that has been finished with chemicals that give it a shiny, reflective surface. It is usually black, and has long been popular for dress and dancing shoes. Most stages of the 
                                preparation of patent leather are the same as for other fine quality leathers. However, it is in the final finishing stage, when it is coated with a lacquer to give it its characteristic glossiness. All leather 
                                is derived from animal skins or hides. Most hides are a byproduct of the meat industry. The hides of cattle slaughtered for beef form the bulk of the leather industry. Other common leathers are made from the 
                                hides of sheep, goats, and pigs, and so-called novelty leathers are derived from reptile skins, such as alligator and snake, and even from the ostrich. Patent leather is usually light and thin, and usually 
                                derived from a calf or a kid. Today, however, patent leather can be made from any kind of hide, and need be of no finer quality than most shoe leathers.</p>
