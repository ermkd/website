                        <h2>What is Harness?</h2>
                        <p>The harness is an attachment between a stationary and non-stationary object and is usually fabricated from rope, cable or webbing and locking hardware. Some safety harnesses are used in combination with a shock absorber, which is used to regulate deceleration when the end of the rope is reached.</p>

                        <h3>How it's Made</h3>
                        <p>Harness leather is usually made from cowhide, though harness leather made from pigskins is sometimes used in saddle seats. 
                           Latigo leather is made exclusively from cowhide. The process used to transform raw hide into harness leather is known as vegetable tanning, 
                           and uses tannin derived from plant matter to give the leather firmness and weight. Latigo leather is created using either vegetable tanning, 
                           chrome tanning or combination tanning. Chrome tanning uses chromium salts to create a soft, mellow hide. Combination tanning uses a combination 
                           of both methods.</p>
                        <h3>Oil Content</h3>
                        <p>Bridle, and Harness leathers, the main difference between the three is oil content.English Bridle has the least amount of oil.  This is evident when working with the leather as it has a slightly drier feel.  It also needs treatment to make it more weather resistant.  Their Latigo line has slightly more oil, which once again is evident in the working of the leather.  The reason for the differing oil content is simply purpose.  Latigo was traditionally used as strap leather (i.e. strapping the saddle to the horse) and therefore needed to be slightly more weather resistant than English Bridle, which is obviously traditionally used in bridle making.</p>
                        <h3>Pull up leather</h3>
                        <p>Pull-up leather is a nubuck with a grease or wax finish. Through use (kinking, stretching, abrasion, etc.), visible traces of wear are quickly formed, as with all waxy leathers. Beneath the wax finish is a sanded surface, so that the patina-development on pull-up leather is fast and strong.</p>
                        <p>There are also leathers, where the surface is not sanded before greasing or waxing. They are aniline leathers. With these leathers, the patina development is not as fast and strong as with the nubuck (sanded) pull-up leathers. Also, this version is often referred to as pull-up.</p>
                        <p>Historically, grain side non-sanded leathers with a greasy finish were called pull-up leathers. There have also been suedes with a grease layer as a finish. Therefore, the term pull-up has to be questioned or examined when offered. However, the patina or vintage look is characteristic for such leathers.</p>
