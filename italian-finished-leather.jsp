                        <p>1. It’s a high quality material. As we’ve stated over and over – Italian leather is a durable and well-made material.

                        <p>2.  Italian Leather is made to last. When compared to other types of leather, Italian leather is the most long-lasting. 
                            It can withstand everyday wear and tear, with most nicks and scratches being easily wiped away. 
                            If you are looking for the most durable products, always look for those leather goods that have a lifetime tome or long guarantee. </p>
                        
                        <p>3. It Is One of a kind! Vegetable tanned Italian leather has a truly one of a kind appearance. 
                            The marks on an the hides are not imperfections – they are the result of the natural tanning process and give a very distinctive look. 
                            No two naturally tanned items ever look alike! </p>
                        
                        <p>4. It’s Timeless Fashion! You’ll see Italian leather on the most exclusive fashion runways. This material practically drips style and sophistication,
                            and it continues to be, one of the most well-loved materials in fashion design.</p>
                        <p>5. Maintaining it’s appearance is easy! Constantly cleaning handbags and purses can be a chore. Italian leather on the other hand, reduces the drudgery.
                            In fact, aging only adds to the beauty and uniqueness of Italian leather. It can be easily cleaned on with a damp cloth form time to time, but isn’t always necessary.</p>

                        <h3>Cost</h3>
                        <p>Don’t settle for cheap knock offs. Price is usually an indicator of the leathers true quality. 
                            This doesn’t mean that you stick to name brand only, in fact check out some smaller and lesser known 
                            leather manufactures; it may still be costly, but not as much as the more well-known designers. 
                            Be aware that even if the leather seems to be good quality, if the price is too low, you are most definitely 
                            purchasing an imitation of cheaply made leather product. Good leather products are more expensive and cost more, 
                            but you will be assured of a high-quality product that will last much longer than cheaper brands.</p>

                        <h3>Warranty</h3>
                        <p>Does your leather product come with a warranty? The best leather goods usually have a 2-year warranty. 
                            Don’t be afraid to ask the sales representative questions about the leather. 
                            Will this product be long lasting? If they salesman seems unsure, don’t make the purchase. 
                            Purchasing leather goods with long or lifetime guarantee ensures that you are getting a good deal.</p>

                        <h3>Check the quality !</h3>
                        <p>Inspect the item in question closely. Take a peek at the stitching, are the stitches straight? 
                            Are there any loose strings? If the craftsmanship is poor, that’s usually an indicator of leather quality. 
                            Look for natural discolorations in the hide. These are not usually imperfections, in fact they are sign of well-tanned leather product. 
                            The details really matter; if the manufacturer has invested in the best leather quality, chances are the item has been well crafted. 
                            Also, take a peek at zips, buckles, pockets and other details.</p>
