                        <h1>What is Patent Leather ?</h1>
                        <p>Patent leather in basic terms is a coated leather that has a glossy, 
                            shiny finish to it and is mostly used for shoes and other accessories (because a patent leather jacket would look horrible). 
                            The origin of patent leather is historically attributed to the UK according to a reference in a British periodical from 1794. 
                            However, it was made popular in the 18th century in the U.S. by Seth Boyden who wanted durable shoes that still looked fancy. 
                            Ironically the Jersey boy never patented the process. These days patent shoes have a plastic coating instead of the linen seed oil-based 
                            lacquer from 1819.</p>

                        <h2>Men Patent Leather Bag</h2>
                        <p>You can’t hide shiny leather shoes so it’s best to go full out. You also don’t need to worry too much about upkeep, 
                            despite their appearance. They’re actually pretty easy to take care of, and if they get a bit dirty you don’t need to 
                            polish them up like other leather shoes, just wipe them down with a damp cloth and they’re back to normal. Don’t worry, 
                            we’ll go through the different steps for the perfect polish in a minute.</p>

                        <h4>HOW TO DESIGN WITH PATENT LEATHER</h4>
                        <p>The beauty of patent leather is how hard wearing it is. Use it as a protective toe of heel cap on your suede or soft leather ballet flats. 
                            Add it as heel on your basic office shoes. Don’t be afraid to mix textures. 
                            Patent leather goes particularly well with hair, suede and faded soft leather. 
                            And, of course, patent all over is a real winner.</p>

                        <h3>Colourful collection</h3>
                        <p>Coloured shoes never looked so good. Patent leather is highly pigmented so the intensity of the colour is really impressive. 
                            See the yellow pumps with a striped cotton bow on the back for a shoe that’s traffic-stopping. 
                            The pinky-coral wedge with a peek of soft shiny gold leather is just adorable. 
                            And those ballet flats? The blue pearl snakeskin teamed with the pink patent is a surefire way to dress up jeans.</p>
